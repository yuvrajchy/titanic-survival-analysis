# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis and builds a machine learning
model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Objective
To analyze passenger attributes and identify key factors that influenced
survival, followed by training a classification model for prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender,
ticket class, fare, and survival outcome.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure
- data/: Dataset files (train, test, submission)
- notebook/: Jupyter notebook containing analysis and model

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive

## Outcome
A baseline Logistic Regression model was built to predict surviva
